# Title: Maps Exercise

# Description:
 This project is a recreation of the google maps application. It utilizes MapBox APIs to center on your current location, as well as to 
 generate GPS directions from a starting location to a destination. These directions can be for cars, walking or biking. Additionally, it includes 
 controls for map zoom and orientation.
 
 # How to run:
 1. Clone repo onto your local machine
 2. Open the repo in your finder
 3. Drag and drop the index.html file into a browser window
 
 # RoadMap:
 In the future, I plan to add additional mapbox features. For example, I will be adding a feature to allow the user to searh locations by category and not
 just by address. I will also be adding additional personalization.
